# Order Processing Kata

## Domain Events

`Order Created` >> `Order Placed`

## Event Store

The event store is a log that can be implemented in an append-only table. For instance, PostgreSQL supports [declarative partitioning](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html), and [table inheritance](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-inherit.html) for partitioning in situations where declarative partitioning falls short.

## Duplicate event handling

At most once handling is built into the domain model.

If multiple messages have the same business semantics, then the consumers will reject duplicates themselves.

Therefore, any given consumer can use the semantics of the message to eliminate duplicates.

## Build

### Build and test

Please, use `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up postgres adminer flyway` to spin up the database, then run the test like this:

```text
gradle test integrationTest
```

#### Regression tests with Cucumber

We decided to put regression tests in the same repository as `order-receipt` microservice. The reasoning behind this decision is that `order-receipt` contains the behaviour the client is interested in. The fact that `order-placement` and `order-report` are called in an specific order is an implementation detail from the point of view of the client.

Please, use `docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up postgres adminer flyway` to spin up the environment (database + microservices), then run the test like this:

```text
gradle order-receipt:regressionTest
```

### Build, test and report to SonarQube

```text
gradle test integrationTest jacocoMerge sonarqube
```

### Test Reports
Gradle writes XML test reports to build/test-results/test and HTML test reports to build/reports/tests/test.

## Deploy in Docker

`gradle :order-receipt:build`

`gradle :order-receipt:jibDockerBuild`

`docker run -d --name order-receipt -p 8080:8080 order-receipt:1.0.0`

`docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up`

`docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps`

`docker inspect docker_order-processing-kata-network`

`docker exec -it -u root activemq /bin/ash`

`apk update && apk add curl`

## Usage

```text
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"reference":"7158","createdAt":"2018-11-03T14:48:17.000000242"}' http://localhost:8080/stores/00-396-261/orders
```
